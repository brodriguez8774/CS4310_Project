# CS4310 Project - Graph Isomorphism


## Author
Brandon Rodriguez


## Description
Semester project. An attempt to investigate and implement a published algorithm about Graph Isomorphism.

IE: How similar or disimilar two graphs are.

This is a NP-Complete problem and as such, is expected to have exponential growth more data is iterated through.

## Languages
Created in Python.

Networkx/Matplotlib extensions used for visual representation.
Such can be installed via:
* pip install plotly   (TODO: No longer needed?)
* pip install networkx
* pip install matplotlib

Documentation can be found at:
* https://plot.ly/python/network-graphs/   (TODO: No longer needed?)
* https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/
* https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html

To use matplotlib, you need "sudo apt install python3-tk"?
(To be honest, I'm not sure which one(s) are or are not required.)

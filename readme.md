# CS4310 Project - Graph Isomorphism

## Author

## Description
Semester project. An attempt to investigate and implement a published algorithm about Graph Isomorphism.

IE: How similar or disimilar two graphs are.

This is a NP-Complete problem and as such, is expected to have exponential growth more data is iterated through.
